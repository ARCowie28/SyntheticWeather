# SyntheticWeather

The tool (scripts and how they might be implemented in ESP-r and Ladybug) is provisionally named "indra". I haven't thought up a smarmy, contrived acronym yet but I'm working on it.

This repository contains scripts create synthetic weather time series from a short weather record of at least one year. Linked to Parag Rastogi's PhD thesis at the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne, EPFL (search on infoscience.epfl.ch or paragrastogi.com) in Lausanne, Switzerland. Parag is the sole author of these scripts and the thesis was supervised by Professor Marilyne Andersen. The scripts are the intellectual property of EPFL, and their redistribution under the liberal BSD-3 license is with the approval of Prof. Marilyne Andersen.

The Python scripts in the repository are the most current versions of the method. No further work is being undertaken on the MATLAB/R scripts. The new scripts consitute a significant change in the algorithm and the new version needs to be tested further - treat it as experimental.

The newer work will also, most likely, be released with a BSD-3 license.

Using the older scripts requires only a valid MATLAB license and R (which is free to download and reuse). While you are free to use the scripts as you please, I am not liable for anything that happens as a result of using my scripts.

If you have questions or concerns, or notice errors, please contact me at contact@paragrastogi.com .

Happy creating fake weather!
