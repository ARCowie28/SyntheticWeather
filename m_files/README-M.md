# Running the M script to generate synthetic weather.
 
## Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have R installed. Make sure R is in your path.
2. Go into R and make sure the package 'forecast' is installed: `install.packages("forecast")`
3. Build up your patience - the script isn't terribly fast but the output is well worth the wait!

## How do I run anything?

1. The first script to run is called `RunThisFirst.m`. This will produce various MAT files, one of which contains the synthetic data.
2. Then, if you want the synthetic data in the form of EPW files, run the script called `RunThisForIndiFiles.m`. 

Yes, I'm terribly proud of my naming system.
