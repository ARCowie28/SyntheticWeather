# Running the M script to generate synthetic weather.
 
## Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have R installed. Make sure R is in your path.
2. Go into R and make sure the package 'forecast' is installed.
3. Build up your patience - the script isn't terribly fast but the output is well worth the wait!
